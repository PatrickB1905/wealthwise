WealthWise is a microservice-based portfolio tracking platform designed to help investors monitor their holdings, analyze performance, and stay informed with relevant financial news in one unified application.

Many investors rely on multiple tools to manage their portfolios, often switching between different dashboards, analytics platforms, and news sources. This can lead to fragmented insights and the inconvenience of managing multiple accounts and credentials. WealthWise addresses this problem by providing a single platform where users can track their positions, view portfolio analytics, and access curated market news related to their holdings.

The platform is built using a microservice architecture with a React frontend and multiple FastAPI backend services responsible for positions management, market data retrieval, analytics computation, and financial news aggregation. Real-time updates are delivered through WebSockets, allowing portfolio changes and pricing information to appear instantly without requiring manual refreshes.

By separating responsibilities into dedicated services, WealthWise remains modular, scalable, and easier to maintain while delivering a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## Architecture Overview

WealthWise is built using a **microservice architecture** designed to keep the system modular, scalable, and maintainable. Instead of placing all functionality in a single backend application, responsibilities are separated into specialized services that communicate through HTTP APIs and real-time events.

This design makes the system easier to evolve over time, allows individual services to scale independently, and keeps each service focused on a clearly defined domain.

### System Overview

The platform consists of:

- **React & TypeScript Frontend**
- **Multiple FastAPI Backend Services**
- **PostgreSQL Database**
- **WebSocket-Based Real-Time Updates (Socket.IO)**
- **Docker Compose Orchestration**

### Backend Services

The backend of WealthWise is organized into a set of dedicated microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the platform. Together, these services power the core functionality of the application while keeping the system modular and scalable.

#### 🧩 Positions Service

The **Positions Service** is the central service of the WealthWise platform and is responsible for managing the user's portfolio data and account lifecycle. It handles authentication, position management, quote snapshot caching, and real-time portfolio updates.

This service acts as the primary interface between the frontend application and the user's stored investment data.

Responsibilities:

- **User authentication and account management**  
  Handles user registration, login, account updates, and secure password storage using hashed credentials and JWT-based authentication.

- **Portfolio position management**  
  Allows users to create, update, close, and delete investment positions while maintaining accurate historical records of buy and sell transactions.

- **Persistent portfolio storage**  
  Stores user accounts, positions, and quote snapshots in a PostgreSQL database using an asynchronous SQLAlchemy data layer.

- **Quote snapshot caching**  
  Maintains cached snapshots of the latest market prices for tracked symbols to reduce unnecessary external API calls and improve response times.

- **Real-time portfolio updates**  
  Uses WebSockets via Socket.IO to broadcast portfolio changes and price updates to connected clients instantly.

- **Event-driven client synchronization**  
  When a user connects, the service retrieves their tracked tickers, loads cached quote snapshots, refreshes stale quotes when necessary, and sends an initial price snapshot to the client.

In addition to handling API requests, the Positions Service runs a **background price polling system** that periodically refreshes market prices for tracked symbols. When new price data is detected, updates are broadcast to all connected clients in real time, ensuring that portfolio values and analytics remain up to date without requiring manual page refreshes.

#### 📈 Market Data Service

The **Market Data Service** is responsible for retrieving and standardizing financial market data used throughout the WealthWise platform. It acts as a dedicated gateway between the internal system and external financial data providers.

By isolating all external data integrations within a single service, WealthWise ensures that the rest of the platform can access reliable market data without needing to manage external API complexity or provider-specific logic.

Responsibilities:

- **External market data retrieval**  
  Fetches real-time and recent pricing information for stocks and cryptocurrencies from third-party financial data providers.

- **Integration with financial data APIs**  
  Communicates with external market data providers and handles provider-specific request formats, response structures, rate limits, and error handling.

- **Data normalization and validation**  
  Transforms raw API responses into a consistent internal format so that all backend services receive standardized quote data regardless of the original provider.

- **Providing a unified quotes API**  
  Exposes a simple `/quotes` endpoint that other services can call to retrieve price data for one or more symbols.

- **Company logo resolution**  
  Retrieves company logo assets associated with stock symbols so that portfolio positions can display recognizable branding alongside financial data.

- **Reliability and fault tolerance**  
  Implements retry logic and error handling to gracefully manage network failures or temporary outages from external data providers.

Currently, the service retrieves pricing data using **Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library**, which provides access to stock market pricing and historical quote information.

For company logos, the service uses **[Logo.dev](https://www.logo.dev/)** to retrieve brand assets based on the company's website domain. The domain is obtained from Yahoo Finance metadata and used to construct a Logo.dev image URL that can be rendered directly by the frontend.

This integration is encapsulated within the Market Data Service so that logo providers can be replaced or extended in the future without requiring changes to other parts of the platform. If a domain-based logo cannot be resolved, the service falls back to the logo URL provided by Yahoo Finance when available.

#### 📊 Analytics Service

The **Analytics Service** is responsible for computing portfolio insights and performance metrics for the WealthWise platform. It processes portfolio data and market prices to generate meaningful analytics that help users understand how their investments are performing over time.

Rather than embedding analytical calculations directly inside transactional services, WealthWise isolates this functionality within a dedicated analytics service. This allows performance calculations to evolve independently while keeping the rest of the system lightweight and responsive.

Responsibilities:

- **Portfolio performance calculations**  
  Computes portfolio-level metrics such as total profit and loss, percentage returns, and overall portfolio value based on the user’s recorded positions and current market prices.

- **Risk and performance metrics**  
  Calculates indicators that help users understand portfolio risk and performance characteristics, such as volatility, drawdowns, and performance trends over time.

- **Portfolio allocation analysis**  
  Breaks down the distribution of investments across different assets and symbols to highlight concentration and diversification.

- **Historical portfolio value tracking**  
  Generates historical performance data that allows users to visualize how their portfolio value has evolved over time.

- **Aggregated analytics endpoints**  
  Exposes structured analytics APIs that the frontend can use to render dashboards, performance summaries, and visualizations.

By isolating portfolio analytics into a dedicated service, WealthWise ensures that computational workloads remain separate from core transactional operations. This design allows the analytics engine to scale independently as more complex metrics and historical calculations are introduced.

#### 📰 News Service

The **News Service** is responsible for aggregating and delivering financial news that is relevant to the user's tracked investments. It provides a centralized way for the WealthWise platform to retrieve, process, and serve market news without exposing the rest of the system to the complexities of external news providers.

By isolating news retrieval and processing into its own service, the platform can integrate with third-party news APIs while keeping the core portfolio and analytics services independent from external content providers.

Responsibilities:

- **Financial news retrieval**  
  Fetches the latest market news articles from external news providers.

- **Integration with external news APIs**  
  Handles provider-specific request formats, response parsing, rate limits, and error handling.

- **Article filtering and normalization**  
  Converts raw news data into a consistent internal format that can be easily consumed by the frontend.

- **Portfolio-relevant news curation**  
  Filters and prioritizes articles based on the symbols tracked in a user's portfolio.

- **News delivery API**  
  Exposes API endpoints that allow the frontend to retrieve curated financial news.

Currently, the service retrieves articles using **[NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)**. The integration is intentionally encapsulated within the News Service so that the underlying provider can be replaced or extended in the future without requiring changes to other parts of the platform.
